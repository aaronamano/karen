# Overview
A backend platform that manages tickets to handle customer complaints. This acts as a virtual data farm of tickets, which are dealt with and distributed to various teams on other virtual "servers" so that they can resolve it.
- <b>Why: </b> To practice backend development, managing databases, and possibly handling cloud-related stuff.
- <b>Who: </b> For teams and big companies working and maintaining large scale projects or something like that
- <b>Uniqueness: </b> Implementing AI-based features such as automatically distributing tickets, handling complaints resolved with FAQ, sending notifications to 3rd party services, prioritizing urgency/severity, etc.
